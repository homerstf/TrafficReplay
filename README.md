# TrafficReplay
A two-node network traffic replay tool

This software was developed as part of a Masters thesis that aimed to develop a simple network traffic replay tool that mimics a two-node network stream.  A pcap file is parsed, header information is loaded into a database for reference, and binary files of packets are created for the replay.  Additionally, configuration files are created for each node and used to synchronize replay between the two nodes.
